       "\"ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Because of the following risks, as well as other risks affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks described below are those we currently believe could materially affect us. The following risks are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements in this report. Risk Factors Relating to Our Company We may not be successful in expanding our operations. Our fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009 was the first year since fiscal 2005 that we were able to achieve operating profits. Although we experienced significant growth in each of the last four fiscal years, our growth significantly slowed in fiscal 2013 and we may not be successful in expanding our operations in future periods. Compared to other companies in our industry, we have limited experience selling products through direct selling, particularly outside the United States. As such, we may have limited insight into trends and other factors that may emerge and affect our business. Additionally, we may not be successful in keeping our leading independent distributors focused and motivated or in aligning their goals with the goals of our company. We also have limited experience expanding into new geographic markets. Although we are seeking to continue our expansion, if we fail to effectively expand our operations into additional markets, we may be unable to generate consistent operating profit growth. Because our Japanese operations account for a significant part of our business, an inability to strengthen our business and work with evolving government regulations in Japan could harm our business. Approximately 33% of our fiscal 2013 revenue was generated in Japan. The Japanese market has changed significantly since we began selling into the market in fiscal 2010 and its regulatory framework continues to change. In 2011, for example, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, made the determination that ashwagandha, 1 of the ingredients in Protandim , is inappropriate for inclusion in a food product in Japan. In January 2013, we announced the release for the Japanese market of a new formulation of Protandim that does not contain ashwagandha. Our revenue in Japan was harmed significantly in fiscal 2013 in part because of the concern among customers that the new formula was not as effective as our original Protandim formula. Our business in Japan could be substantially harmed in the longer term if we determine, or if the market continues to perceive, that this formulation of Protandim does not have the same effect as the original formulation or if the formulation faces additional challenges from regulatory agencies in Japan. Other factors that could impact our results in Japan include continued or increased levels of regulatory or media scrutiny and any regulatory actions, or any adoption of more restrictive regulations, in response to such scrutiny; our inability to galvanize our leading independent distributors in Japan; significant weakening of the Japanese yen; 17 increased regulatory constraints with respect to the claims we can make regarding the efficacy of Protandim , which could limit our ability to effectively market that product; the initiatives we have implemented in Japan, which are patterned after successful initiatives implemented in the U.S., may not generate renewed growth or increased productivity among our independent distributors in Japan, and may cost more or require more time to implement than we have anticipated; inappropriate activities by our independent distributors and any resulting regulatory actions against us or our independent distributors; discord among our top leaders within our independent distributor ranks or the loss of these leaders to other ne2rk marketing companies or otherwise; improper practices of other direct selling companies or their independent distributors that increase regulatory or media scrutiny of our industry; and weakness in the economy or consumer confidence. In January 2013, we transiti1d our operations in Japan from a not for resale model to our traditional direct selling model. We believe our transition to a direct selling model in Japan, the introduction of a new formulation of Protandim into the market and our global recall of Protandim contributed significantly to our slower sales growth in Japan during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013 Our slower sales growth in sales could continue, and we could experience a decline in sales, if the transition to a direct selling model is less successful than anticipated or if distributors in Japan do not accept our products and business opportunity as anticipated. Additionally, there is a high level of regulatory scrutiny of the direct selling industry in Japan; several direct selling companies have been penalized for actions of distributors that violated applicable regulations. Such penalties have included suspension from sponsoring activities in Japan. If our distributors fail to comply with applicable regulations in Japan, regulators could take action against us, including a suspension of our sponsoring activities, or we could receive negative media attention, either of which could harm our business significantly. We may not succeed in growing existing markets or opening new markets. In fiscal 2013 we launched international operations in Hong Kong and Canada. We now have international operations in Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia and Mexico. In fiscal 2013 we derived approximately 37% of our revenues from our international operations. We believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts. However, despite our efforts to do so, we may not succeed in growing our existing international markets, entering new international markets on a timely basis, or achieving profitability in new markets. We must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any international market. Also, before marketing commences in a new country or market, it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country. In addition to significant regulatory barriers, we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere. We may be required to reformulate 1 or more of our products, including Protandim , before commencing sales in a given country. Once we have entered a market, we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market. We may not be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals in new markets, or we may have insufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner. If we are able to expand our operations, we may be unable to successfully manage our future growth . Our business has grown significantly from fiscal 2009, the year we we initiated our direct selling model, through fiscal 2013 This growth placed substantial strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources. If we are able to continue expanding our operations in the United States and in other countries where we believe our products will be successful, we may experience periods of rapid growth, which will require additional resources. Any such growth could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources, and we will need to train, motivate, and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international, technical, and other professionals. In addition, we will need to expand the scope of our infrastructure and our physical resources. Any failure to expand these areas and implement appropriate procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We rely on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption in these systems could adversely affect our business. We depend on our information technology, or IT, systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, including our finance and accounting transactions, to manage our independent distributor compensation plan and to provide analytical information to management. Our IT systems are an essential comp1nt of our business and growth strategies, and a serious 18 disruption to our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and ne2rk failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches and computer viruses. Any disruption could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, if we experience future growth, we will need to scale or change some of our systems to accommodate the increasing number of independent distributors and other customers. For example, we are in the process of implementing a new back office system to be used by our independent distributors. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to successfully make that change or if our independent distributors do not adapt well to the new system. Our independent distributors could fail to comply with applicable legal requirements or our distributor policies and procedures, which could result in claims against us that could harm our business. Our distributors are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction, motivation and oversight as we would if distributors were employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our distributors will participate in our marketing strategies or plans, accept our introduction of new products, or comply with our distributor policies and procedures. Extensive federal, state, local and international laws regulate our business, products and direct selling activities. Because we have expanded into foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our independent distributors differ due to the different legal requirements of each country in which we do business. While our distributor policies and procedures are designed to govern distributor conduct, it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of distributors and their independent status. Violations by our independent distributors of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our products and operations and harm our business reputation. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our independent distributors. Inability of new products to gain distributor and market acceptance could harm our business. In fiscal 2013 we introduced Canine Health to our independent distributors and other customers. We may seek to further expand our product portfolio. However, any new products we introduce may not gain distributor and market acceptance to the extent we anticipate or project. Factors that could affect our ability to introduce new products include, among others, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third party research and collaborative arrangements, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products and the difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences. In addition, new products we introduce may not be successful or generate substantial revenue. The introduction of a new product could also negatively impact other product lines to the extent our distributor leaders focus their efforts on the new product instead of an existing product. If any of our products fail to gain distributor acceptance, we could see an increase in product returns. A substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign markets, exposing us to the risks of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, increased tariffs, foreign currency fluctuations, disruptions or conflicts with our third party importers and similar risks associated with foreign operations. A substantial portion of our sales are generated outside the United States. If we are successful in entering additional foreign markets, we anticipate that the percentage of our sales generated outside the United States will increase. There are substantial risks associated with foreign operations. For example, a foreign government may impose trade or foreign exchange restrictions or increased tariffs, which could negatively impact our operations and financial results. We are also exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. For instance, purchases from suppliers are generally made in U.S. dollars while sales to distributors are generally made in local currencies. Accordingly, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus a foreign currency could have a negative impact on us. Specifically, because a significant percentage of our revenues are generated in Japan, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Additionally, we may be negatively impacted by conflicts with or disruptions caused or faced by third party importers, as well as conflicts between such importers and local governments or regulatory agencies. Our operations in some markets also may be adversely affected by political, economic and social instability in foreign countries. Global economic conditions could harm our business. Global economic conditions continue to be challenging and unpredictable. Consumer confidence and spending have declined in recent years and the global credit crisis has limited access to capital for many companies and consumers. The global economic downturn could adversely impact our business by causing a decline in demand for our products, particularly if the economic conditions are prolonged or worsen. In addition, poor global economic conditions may adversely impact access to capital for us and our suppliers, may decrease our independent distributors ability to obtain or maintain credit, and may otherwise adversely impact our operations and overall financial condition. 19 In the past, we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain our level of internal controls in the future, our shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price could suffer. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements included in our Form 10 K for fiscal year 2011, as well as certain other previously issued financial statements, we concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. While we were able to remedy these material weaknesses during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013, as we expand our business, especially outside of the United States, if we fail to maintain our control procedures, or otherwise comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, it could negatively affect our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information. If we are to expand our product offerings, we may need to raise additional capital. We primarily depend on Protandim for our revenue. We may decide to expand our product portfolio and may seek to do so by acquiring products by license or through product or company acquisitions. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our requirements in this regard, we may need to raise additional capital, which may be dilutive to our existing shareholders. If we are unable to raise additional required capital in a timely manner, we could be forced to reduce our growth plans. We could be exposed to certain environmental liabilities due to our past operations and property ownership. During the 1990s, we owned mining properties in the Yaak River mining district of Montana. We never conducted any mining operations or ore processing on these properties, nor have we performed on site environmental studies on these properties. The State of Montana Department of Environmental Quality believed that the properties may contain residues from past mining. We may be liable for material environmental liabilities associated with these properties. In addition, until November 2004, we owned land in Lawrence, Colorado. We are not aware of any environmental liabilities with respect to this land. The party that acquired the land from us assumed any environmental liability related to the land. N1theless, a governmental agency or a private party could seek to hold us accountable for such environmental liabilities, if any. Risk Factors Relating to our Business and Industry We primarily depend on a single product for our revenue. Although we generate revenue through the sale of LifeVantage TrueScience and Canine Health , we primarily rely on the sale of Protandim for our revenue. We do not have a broad portfolio of other products that we could rely on to support our operations if we were to experience any difficulty with the manufacture, marketing, sale or distribution of Protandim . For example, our revenue was adversely impacted because sales of Protandim slowed following our voluntary product recall during fiscal 2013 If we have similar problems in the future, our results could be negatively affected. In addition, we may be unable to sustain or increase the price or sales levels for Protandim , which could harm our business. High quality material for our products may be difficult to obtain or expensive. Raw materials account for a significant portion of our manufacturing costs. Suppliers may be unable or unwilling to provide the raw materials our manufacturers need in the quantities requested, at a price we are willing to pay, or that meet our quality standards. We are also subject to potential delays in the delivery of raw materials caused by events beyond our control, including labor disputes, transportation interruptions and changes in government regulations. Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could, among other things, substantially increase the cost of such materials, require reformulation or repackaging of products, require the qualification of new suppliers, or result in our inability to meet customer demands. In December 2012 we commenced a voluntary recall of certain lots of Protandim to alleviate concerns that some Protandim tablets may have included small metal fragments. We discovered these small metal fragments in certain batches of turmeric extract, 1 of the raw materials used to manufacture Protandim . We purchase turmeric extract from third party suppliers. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain a reliable source of turmeric extract or any other raw material used in the manufacturing of our products that meets our quality standards. Although our independent distributors are independent contractors, improper distributor actions that violate laws or regulations could harm our business. Our independent distributors are not employees and act independent of us. However, activities by our independent distributors that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third party actions against us, which could 20 harm our business. Our independent distributors agree to abide by our strict policies and procedures designed to ensure our independent distributors will comply with legal requirements. We have a compliance department that addresses violations of our independent distributors when they become known to us. However, given the size of our independent distributor force, we experience problems with independent distributors violating our policies and procedures from time to time and are not always able to discover such violations. 1 of our most significant areas of risk with respect to independent distributor activities relates to improper product claims and claims regarding the business opportunity of being an independent distributor. Any determination by the Federal Trade Commission or other similar governmental agency outside the United States that we or our independent distributors are not in compliance with applicable laws could harm our business. Even if governmental actions do not result in rulings or orders against us, they could create negative publicity that could detrimentally affect our efforts to recruit or motivate independent distributors and attract customers. As we experience growth in the number of our independent distributors, we have seen an increase in sales aids and promotional material being produced by distributors and distributor groups in some markets. This places an increased burden on us to monitor compliance of such materials and increases the risk that such materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims in violation of our policies and applicable regulations. As we expand internationally, our distributors sometimes attempt to anticipate additional new markets that we may enter in the future and begin marketing and sponsoring activities in markets where we are not qualified to conduct business. We could face fines or other legal action if our distributors violate applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to retain our existing independent distributors and recruit additional independent distributors, our revenue will not increase and may even decline. Our independent distributors may terminate their services at any time, and, like most direct selling companies, we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience turnover among independent distributors. Independent distributors who join our company to purchase our products for personal consumption or for short term income goals may only stay with us for a short time. While we take steps to help train, motivate, and retain independent distributors, we cannot accurately predict the number or productivity of our independent distributors. Our operating results will be harmed if we and our independent distributor leaders do not generate sufficient interest in our business to retain existing independent distributors and attract new independent distributors. The number and productivity of our independent distributors could be harmed by several factors, including any adverse publicity regarding us, our products, our distribution channel, or our competitors; lack of interest in existing or new products or their failure to achieve desired results; lack of a compelling business opportunity sufficient to generate the interest and commitment of new independent distributors; any changes we might make to our independent distributor compensation plan; any negative public perception of our products or their ingredients; any negative public perception of our independent distributors and direct selling businesses in general; our actions to enforce our policies and procedures; any efforts to sell our products through competitive channels; any regulatory actions or charges against us or others in our industry; and general economic and business conditions. We are dependent upon third parties to manufacture our product. We currently rely on third parties to manufacture the products we sell. We are dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of third party manufacturers' facilities. If any of our current manufacturers are unable or unwilling to fulfill our manufacturing requirements or seek to impose unfavorable terms, we will likely have to seek out other manufacturers, which could disrupt our operations and we may not be successful in finding alternative manufacturing resources. In addition, competitors who perform their own manufacturing may have an advantage over us with respect to pricing, availability of product, and in other areas through their control of the manufacturing process. 21 We are subject to risks related to product recalls. We have implemented measures in our manufacturing process that are designed to prevent and detect defects in our products, including the inclusion of foreign contaminants. However, such measures may not prevent or reveal defects or detect contaminants in our products and such defects and contaminants may not become apparent until after our products have been sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that product defects will occur, or that our products will contain foreign contaminants, and that such defects and contaminants will require a product recall. We do not maintain product recall insurance. In December 2012, we commenced a voluntary recall of certain lots of Protandim to alleviate concerns that some tablets may have included small metal fragments. We discovered these small metal fragments in certain batches of turmeric extract, an ingredient in Protandim we purchase from third party suppliers. Product recalls and subsequent remedial actions can be expensive to implement and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product recalls could result in negative publicity and public concerns regarding the safety of our products, either of which could harm the reputation of our products and our business and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. The ultimate costs of the recall we commenced in December 2012, including financial costs, injury to our reputation, liability and reduced growth prospects, are not yet known to us. The events that lead to and followed our voluntary product recall in December 2012 strained our relationships with some of our third party manufacturers. Additionally, following the voluntary recall we implemented more stringent measures, including several redundant measures, in our manufacturing process to detect contaminates. Third party manufacturers may be reluctant to implement these redundant measures, may refuse to manufacture our products and these additional measures may increase our cost of goods sold and further strain our relationships with manufacturers. Ne2rk Marketing is heavily regulated. Various government agencies throughout the world regulate ne2rk marketing practices. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as pyramid schemes, which compensate participants for recruiting additional participants irrespective of product sales, use high pressure recruiting methods and or do not involve legitimate products. Complying with these rules and regulations can be difficult and requires the devotion of significant resources on our part. We may not be able to continue business in existing markets or commence operations in new markets if we are unable to comply with these laws or adjust to changes in these laws. Unfavorable publicity could materially harm our business. We are highly dependent upon consumers' perceptions of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products, as well as competitive products distributed by other companies. In the past we have experienced negative publicity that has harmed our business. Critics of our industry and other individuals whose interests are not aligned with our interests, have in the past and may in the future utilize the Internet, the press and other means to publish criticism of the industry, our company, our products and our competitors, or make allegations regarding our business and operations, or the business and operations of our competitors. For instance, several prominent companies in our industry have been targeted by short sellers who profit if a company's stock price decreases. 1 such company was recently targeted by a short seller who, after taking a significant short position, publicly made allegations regarding the legality of the company's ne2rk marketing model. Short sellers have an incentive to publicly criticize our industry and business model and any such criticism may adversely affect our stock price. Future scientific research or publicity may not be favorable to our industry or any particular product, including Protandim . Because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting or claimed to have resulted from the consumption or use of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on us. Such adverse publicity could arise even if the claims are unsubstantiated or if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from failure to consume or use such products as directed. Adverse publicity could also increase our product liability exposure, result in increased regulatory scrutiny and lead to the initiation of private lawsuits. Our direct selling program could be found to be not in compliance with current or newly adopted laws or regulations in 1 or more markets, which could prevent us from conducting our business in these markets and harm our financial condition and operating results. Some of the legal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling business model are ambiguous and subject to interpretation. As a result, regulators and courts have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations, and the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental agencies or courts can change. Recent allegations by short sellers regarding the legality of multi level marketing companies have also created intense public scrutiny of our industry and could cause governmental agencies to change their enforcement and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations. The failure of our business to comply with current or newly adopted regulations or interpretations could negatively impact our business in a particular market or in general and may adversely affect our share price. 22 We may become involved in legal proceedings that are expensive, time consuming and, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results. Litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of litigation which we may in the future become party to; the impact of certain of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material. We are currently involved in various lawsuits, both as a plaintiff and as defendant. While we believe the suits against us are without merit, they are quite costly to defend and we cannot be assured that we will ultimately prevail. If we do not prevail and are required to pay damages, it could harm our business. Regulations governing the production and marketing of our skin care product could harm our business. LifeVantage TrueScience , our anti aging skin care product, is subject to various domestic and foreign laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic products and set forth regulations for determining whether a product can be marketed as a cosmetic or requires further approval as an over the counter drug. A determination that LifeVantage TrueScience impacts the structure or function of the human body, or improper marketing claims by our distributors may lead to a determination that LifeVantage TrueScience requires pre market approval as a drug. Such regulations in any given market can limit our ability to import products and can delay product launches as we go through the registration and approval process for those products. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we could face enforcement action against us and we could be fined, forced to alter or stop selling LifeVantage TrueScience and or be required to adjust our operations. Our operations also could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute LifeVantage TrueScience or impose additional burdens or requirements on the contents of our personal care product or require us to reformulate our product. Our business is subject to strict government regulations. The manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, sale and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by 1 or more federal agencies, including, in the United States, the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient is adulterated or misbranded or both, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we make to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a health claim. Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing that particular dietary supplement product, or making certain claims for that product. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any product that we are required to remove from the market, which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects. Additional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. In recent years, there has been increased pressure in the United States and other markets to increase regulation of dietary supplements. New regulations could impose additional restrictions, including requiring reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. In the United States, for example, some legislators and industry critics continue to push for increased regulatory authority by the FDA over nutritional supplements. Our business could be harmed if more restrictive legislation is successfully introduced and adopted in the future. In the United States, the FTC Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, or Guides, require disclosure of material connections between an endorser and the company they are endorsing and do not allow marketing using atypical results. Our independent distributors have historically used testimonials to market and sell Protandim . Producing marketing materials that conform to the requirements and restrictions of the Guides may diminish the impact of our marketing efforts and negatively impact our sales results. If we or our distributors fail to comply with these Guides, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against us and we could be fined and or forced to alter our marketing materials. Our operations also could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to 23 market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies or require us to reformulate our products. In addition, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, which was passed by Congress in 2006, imposes significant regulatory requirements on dietary supplements, packers and distributors including the reporting of serious adverse events to the FDA and record keeping requirements. Complying with this legislation could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. We and our suppliers are also required to comply with FDA regulations with respect to current Good Manufacturing Procedures in manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements. These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with procedures that we and our subcontractors must develop and make available for inspection by the FDA. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third party suppliers or vendors are not able to comply with these rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third party products. In 2011, the FDA published draft guidance which is intended, among other things, to help manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplement products determine when they are required to file with the FDA a New Dietary Ingredient, or NDI, notification with respect to a dietary supplement product. In this draft guidance, the FDA highlighted the necessity for marketers of dietary supplements to submit NDI notifications as an important preventive control to ensure that consumers are not exposed to potential unnecessary public health risks in the form of new ingredients with unknown safety profiles. Although we do not believe that Protandim contains an NDI, if the FDA were to conclude that we should have filed an NDI notification for Protandim , then we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA. Such enforcement actions could include product seizures and injunctive relief being granted against us, any of which would harm our business. Legislation known as the Dietary Supplement Labeling Act was recently introduced in the United States Senate. This proposed legislation purports to help consumers distinguish between dietary supplements that are safe and those that have potentially serious side effects or drug interactions. The Dietary Supplement Labeling Act, if passed and enacted as law, would require dietary supplement manufacturers to disclose known ingredient risks and display mandatory warnings if a product contains an ingredient that could cause potentially serious adverse events. Although it is not currently known if, or in what form, the Dietary Supplement Labeling Act will be enacted, it could create additional regulatory burdens on our business, increase our costs and harm our operations. We are subject to the risk of investigatory and enforcement action by the FTC. We are subject to the risk of investigatory and enforcement action by the FTC based on our advertising claims and marketing practices. The FTC routinely reviews product advertising, including websites, to identify significant questionable advertising claims and practices. The FTC has brought many actions against dietary supplement companies based upon allegations that applicable advertising claims or practices were deceptive or not substantiated. If the FTC initiates an investigation, the FTC can initiate pre complaint discovery that may be nonpublic in nature. Any investigation may be very expensive to defend and may result in an adverse ruling or in a consent decree. Government authorities may question our tax positions or transfer pricing policies or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business. As a U.S. company doing business in international markets through subsidiaries, we are subject to various tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between our company and our subsidiaries. From time to time, we are audited by tax regulators in the United States and in our foreign markets. If regulators challenge our tax positions, corporate structure, transfer pricing mechanisms or intercompany transfers, we may be subject to fines and payment of back taxes, our effective tax rate may increase and our operations may be harmed. Tax rates vary from country to country, and, if tax authorities determine that our profits in 1 jurisdiction may need to be increased, we may not be able to fully utilize all foreign tax credits that are generated, which will increase our effective tax rate. For example, our federal corporate income tax rate in the United States is 35%. If our profitability in a higher tax jurisdiction, such as Japan where our tax rate in fiscal 2013 was approximately 38%, increases disproportionately to the rest of our business, our effective tax rate may increase. The various customs, exchange control and transfer pricing laws are continually changing and are subject to the interpretation of government agencies. We may experience increased efforts by customs authorities in foreign countries to reclassify our products or otherwise increase the level of duties we pay on our products. Despite our efforts to be aware of and comply with such laws, and changes to and interpretations thereof, there is a risk that we may not continue to operate in compliance with such laws. We may need to adjust our operating procedures in response to such changes, and as a result, our business may suffer. In addition, due to the international nature of our business, we are subject from time to time to reviews and audits by foreign taxing authorities of other jurisdictions in which we conduct business throughout the world. 24 Non compliance with anti corruption laws could harm our business. Our international operations are subject to anti corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, also known as the FCPA. Any allegations that we are not in compliance with anti corruption laws may require us to dedicate time and resources to an internal investigation of the allegations or may result in a government investigation. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, and other penalties. Although we have implemented anti corruption policies and controls to protect against violation of these laws, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact our business. Our future performance will depend upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our executive and senior management team and scientific staff. Our success depends to a significant extent both upon the continued services of our current executive and senior management team and scientific staff, as well as our ability to attract, hire, motivate, and retain additional qualified management and scientific staff in the future. In addition, competition for executive and senior staff in the dietary supplement market is intense, and our operations could be adversely affected if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel. All of our employees are at will employees, which means any employee may quit at any time and we may terminate any employee at any time. We do not carry key person insurance covering members of senior management or our employees. We may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our distributors, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Our distributors are subject to taxation, and in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate records. In the event that local laws and regulations or the interpretation of local laws and regulations change to require us to treat our independent distributors as employees, or that our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in 1 or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. If our distributors were deemed to be employees rather than independent contractors, we would also face the threat of increased vicarious liability for their actions. The dietary supplement market is highly competitive. Our flagship product, Protandim , competes in the dietary supplements market, which is large, highly competitive and fragmented. Participants include specialty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchants, multi level marketing organizations, on line merchants, mail order companies, and a variety of other smaller participants. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess better manufacturing, independent distribution and marketing capabilities than we do. We believe that the market is also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, including various prescription drugs, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. Moreover, because of regulatory restrictions concerning claims about the efficacy of dietary supplements, we may have difficulty differentiating our products from our competitors products, and competing products entering the dietary supplements market could harm our revenue. In the United States and Japan, we also compete for sales with heavily advertised national brands manufactured by large pharmaceutical and food companies, as well as other retailers. In addition, as some products become more mainstream, we experience increased competition for those products as more participants enter the market. Our international competitors include large international pharmacy chains, major international supermarket chains, and other large U.S. based companies with international operations. We may not be able to compete effectively and our attempt to do so may result in increased pricing pressure, which may result in lower margins and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brand. The loss of our intellectual property rights in our products could permit our competitors to manufacture their own version of our products. We have attempted to protect our intellectual property rights in our products through a combination of patents, patent applications, confidentiality agreements, non compete agreements and other contractual protection mechanisms, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents or various contractual protections may not adequately protect our intellectual property. In addition, we could be required to expend significant resources to defend our rights to proprietary information, and may not be successful in such defense. Moreover, our intellectual property rights are more limited outside of the United States than they are in the United States. As such, we may not be successful in preventing third parties from copying or misappropriating our intellectual property. There can also be no assurance that pending patent applications owned by us will result in patents being issued to us, that patents 25 issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that such patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our products or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to negotiate to obtain licenses to conduct our business, and any required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on confidentiality and non compete agreements with certain employees, independent distributors, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge. Third parties might claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Although the dietary supplement industry has historically been characterized by products with naturally occurring ingredients, recently it is becoming more common for suppliers and competitors to apply for patents or develop proprietary technologies and processes. Third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us despite our efforts to avoid such infringement. Such claims could prevent us from offering competitive products or result in litigation or threatened litigation. Our business is susceptible to product liability claims. The manufacture and sale of any product for human consumption raises the risk of product liability claims. These claims may derive from the product itself or a contaminant found in the product from the manufacturing, packaging, sales process or even due to tampering by unauthorized third parties. Our products consist of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other ingredients that are classified as foods or dietary supplements and are not subject to pre market regulatory approval in the United States. Our products could contain contaminated substances, and some of our products contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur. In addition, third party manufacturers produce all of the products we sell. As a distributor of products manufactured by third parties, we may also be liable for various product liability claims for these products despite not manufacturing them. We may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that our products include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances. Any product liability claim against us could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, which in turn could adversely affect our revenues and operating income. Although we maintain insurance coverage, there is a risk that our insurance will not cover our potential exposure completely or would fail to cover a particular claim, in which case we may not have the financial resources to satisfy such claim. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not covered by our insurance policy. Economic, political, and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our revenues and international growth prospects. As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to expand our international presence. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent to operating in foreign countries, and any expansion of our international operations will increase the effects of these risks. These risks include, among others political and economic instability of foreign markets; foreign governments restrictive trade policies; inconsistent product regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments; the imposition of, or increase in, duties, taxes, government royalties, or non tariff trade barriers; difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentially longer payment cycles; increased costs in maintaining international marketing efforts; problems entering international markets with different cultural bases and consumer preferences; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and our growth strategy. 26 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock If the holders of our outstanding warrants and options exercise their securities for shares of common stock, we will issue up to 15,251,342 shares, which will materially dilute the voting power of our currently outstanding common stock and could cause our stock price to decline. As of June 30, 2013, we had 117,088,257 shares of common stock outstanding. As of June 30, 2013, we also had outstanding warrants that are exercisable for an aggregate of 8,241,390 shares of common stock and stock options outstanding for an aggregate of 7,009,952 shares of common stock. The issuance of these shares will dilute the voting power of our currently outstanding common stock and could cause our stock price to decline. Our stock price may experience future volatility. The trading price of our common stock has historically been subject to wide fluctuations. The price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results, material announcements by us or competitors, governmental regulatory action, conditions in the dietary supplement industry, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control, and some of which do not have a strong correlation to our operating performance. Substantial sales of shares may impact the market price of our common stock . If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may decline. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we consider appropriate. We have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date. Although during fiscal 2013 we paid an aggregate of $7.1 million to repurchase 2,972,080 shares of our common stock, we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility, if any, may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock is likely to be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. When considering the forgoing risk factors, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and the documents incorporated by reference. We have no obligation and do not undertake to update or revise any such forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report.
